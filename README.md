Conway's Game of Life Automaton
===============================

1. Application takes an -i(input) argument which represents a file that contains state of automaton (first generation). For input file will be created an bidimensional array with according number of rows and columns. After all the data from input will be loaded to new bidimensional array.

2. Application takes -n (number of iterations) argument which represents a number of generations.


For each generation created array will be checked if it needs to be maximized or minimized.
